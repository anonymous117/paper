# Performance Modeling at a Discount

This repository provides an extended version of the evaluation presented in the IPDPS 2020 paper submission "Performance Modeling at a Discount". In order to ensure the general reproducibility of our results, it contains a detailed description of how we evaluated our new modeling approach using synthetic analysis. Furthermore, we also provide the models we created for the case studies and their analysis.

The file **extended_evaluation.pdf** in the root directory contains the extended version of the evaluation. Furthermore, the **README** files in the sub folders additionally explain the structure and type of the evaluation data.
