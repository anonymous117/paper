### Info

For three model paramters we experimented with different numbers of measurement points per parameter. Each folder contains experiments considering a different number of points per parameter to create the single parameter experiments. We tested with 5, 6 and 7 points. We compare the accuracy of both modelers against each other and use the experiments to find the optimal number of repetitions per point and the number of points that should be used to acquire optimal results. Additionally, we experimented with different point selection strategies and took a look at how the modelers perform when exposed to different levels of noise.
