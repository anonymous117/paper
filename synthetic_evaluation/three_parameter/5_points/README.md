### Info

For the experiments with 5 points per model parameter we ran experiments with different amounts of noise (0%, +-1%, +-2% and +-5%) and two different point selection strategies. Strategy one is to use the cheapest available points for modeling. Strategy two is to use the most expensive points for modeling. As for the other experiments we tested different numbers of repetitions and modeler configurations and compared both modelers with each other, considering their accuracy and modeling cost.
