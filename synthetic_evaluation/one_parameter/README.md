### Info

Additionally to the different number of parameters we experimented with different numbers of measurement points per parameter. Each folder contains experiments considering a different number of points per parameter to create the single parameter experiments. We tested with 5, 6 and 7 points. In conclusion more points result in more accuracte models. However, in many cases it is not possible to measure 6 or 7 points as it is too expensive.
