### Info

For one model paramter we experimented with different numbers of measurement points per parameter. Each folder contains experiments considering a different number of points per parameter to create the single parameter experiments. We tested with 5, 6 and 7 points. In this case we have only one model parameter, hence both modeler use the same approach and points to create the models. Therefore, there is no need for a comparison, but we use the experiments to find the optimal number of repetitions per point and the number of points that should be used to acquire optimal results.
